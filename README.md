## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Construction üë∑

This application contains the key CRUD requirement functionality and utilises a data handling document based database, MongoDB. Functionality is created using Flask, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Materialize framework was used in building fronted structure to make sure app is responsive as possible and can be used on multiple screen sizes.

<p id="design"></p>

### Design:

#### Color Scheme:

The assumption for the application was simple: must look professional so the color selection is the key.
- Main colors are:


#### Typography:

The "Roboto" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly.
Roboto offers a pleasing reading ability to the user and is easy on the eyes. Font is  clean, professional and very readable amongst all major languages.

#### Content Structure:

The application is primarily rectangular shaped with by default subtle rounded edges around buttons to create a nice flow for the user. Content is grouped in sections, an example of this would be the Home page:
- The main body of the page is horizontally separated into sections, we have a search section where user can find ads by text, category section where user can choose ads by their category, and finally we have a recent added ads section where user can see 8 last added ads. Page is finished by footer  where we can find short site description, email address and social links.

Despite the large amount of content, the user is not overwhelmed, thanks to simple but effective layout.

#### Wireframes:

- <a href="static/readmeimages/desktop-wireframes.pdf" target="_blank">Desktop wireframes</a>
- <a href="static/readmeimages/mobile-wireframes.pdf" target="_blank">Mobile wireframes</a>

Update:

The first raw design wos drawn on a piece of paper and then the idea was transferred to an advanced creator. However, while creating application changes were made to improve the appearance and functionality.

- Footer has been completely redesigned. The explore links have been removed, social media has been limited to icons, about info has been added so that the user can familiarize with website assumptions. All info has been placed vertically on all screen sizes.
- Login and registration pages has been split into two separate pages.
- On admin site tables with all categories, all users and reported ads have been added.

<p id="testing"></p>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing üî•

<p id="manualtesting"></p>

### Manual Testing:

Testing and improving the application was carried out throughout its development. The main testing tool was Google Chrome dev tools and devices such as phone, tablet and laptop with several versions of browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera).

Materialize framework was tested extensively to ensure that the Mobile first Responsive Approach was achieved with this project. The Application was tested on my Lenovo Thinkbook laptop and large Samsung TV screen, Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile and Lenovo tablet. The application worked fine on all devices. If something didn't work as it should during the test it was immediately checked and corrected in DevTools and then implemented into the code and checked again. If test passed it was committed and pushed into repository.

Python based code was checked and tested using PEP8 online validator and finished without any errors.

JavaScript and jQuery were tested using JS Hint and finished without errors.

CSS was validated using W3C's Jigsaw Validator and finished without errors.

Passing the HTML file content through the W3C Validator for HTML resulted in numerous errors triggered by Jinja's framework embedded within the document. The standard HTML is W3C compliant, no other errors found.
